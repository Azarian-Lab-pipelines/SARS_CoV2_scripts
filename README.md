# SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing scripts
- Repo contains code to:
	1. Assemble SC2 amplicon sequences using the V2, V3, VarSkip, and Midnight primer kits
		- Mainly useful for running on an HPC using Linux and SLURM workload manager
	2. Perform QC and amplicon drop-out analysis
		- Useful for getting a snap shot of sequencing quality and possible amplicon drop-out issues

- Repo is currently in progress
